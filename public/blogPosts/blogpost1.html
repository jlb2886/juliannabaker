        <p class="blogBody">
            I decided to purchase Dashinsky’s book off of amazon called “Solving Product Design Exercises” and I have a few opinions about it. Firstly I would like to say that this book gives a lot of great advice. I give Dashinsky a lot of credit when it comes to walking a new product designer through what an interview question might be like and how to solve problems that are thrown at you in an interview.
            <br><br>
            In Chapter 3 Dashinsky walks the audience through practice questions and solutions that he made. A large part of this practice is to know your audience and I believe that there are a few missed steps in this process. He first explains the why, the reason you are designing this new product. Then he goes into the who, who is your audience you are designing for. When we focus on the target audience we can consider multiple personas and in those personas that will represent our audience, we can add users of all different abilities.

        <p class="blogBody">
            In chapter 3.1 Dashinsky is walking the audience through the design process to design a kiosk and its interface. The client is looking for a kiosk design that will dispense soap and shampoo. Dashinsky explains the situation the customer might be in while trying to refill their soap/shampoo bottle. They could have grocery bags in their hands and want to interact with the interface with one hand. I appreciate when the designer points situations like this out to the audience because this is a situational disability.
            <br><br>
            Whether the customer is situationally disabled, temporarily disabled, or permanently disabled every person should have access to these products and we as designers need to make a more conscious effort to design for these interfaces and products. So when we come across a design problem we need to spend a little more time on the audience section of our design process. While we think about who might be using these products we could make personas that would cover different abilities that people might have.
            <br><br>
            We can think about the audience in different situations and having different abilities. In this design problem we need to think more about the what ifs. For example:
        </p>
        <p class="blogBody">
            “What if our customer is left-handed?”<br>
            Then we design it so the customer can easily interact with the kiosk using their dominant hand.
            <br><br>
            “What if our customer is in a wheelchair?” <br>
            Then we need to design the kiosk so that the interface can be accessed using a wheelchair as well as their payment method.
        </p>
        <h1 class="blogPostName headlineName font-weight-light"><span class="purple-text">Conclusion</span></h1>
        <p class="blogBody">
            With Dashinsky’s design he states that most people are right-handed so the payment should go on the right side of the kiosk, and he is right. About 90% of our population is right handed but this design could be awkward to work with for a user that is left handed and it is easy enough to change the placement of the payment insert to be in the center of the kiosk. You can see this type of payment design in many real world situations that a user is also familiar with, such as payment at a gas pump. In his design it is also on the right side of the kiosk high enough that I do not believe someone that is in a wheelchair would be able to access it.
            <br><br>
            There are so many more ways to look at this problem, so I will mark his design with a pen for you to more visually see my thoughts.

        <p class="blogBody">
            Overall I do believe that Dashinsky has a great perspective and an experienced perspective in the world of design but I do believe that we need to teach designers, especially just entering the working world, about how we can think more about accessibility in our everyday design problems. Dashinsky’s design process to approach these problems was very well laid out and easy to comprehend, and adding just a little more analysis to the user section could help us think more about how to make our designs more accessible. Thinking about accessibility earlier in our design process will allow us to reach a broader audience as well as save time and money if we were to think about accessibility after the product has been made.
